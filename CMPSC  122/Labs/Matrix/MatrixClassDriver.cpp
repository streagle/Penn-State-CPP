Test Run Output
===============

The following shows a matrix created using the default constructor:

	0


The following shows a matrix created using the second constructor:

	2     3     4     5     6
	3     4     5     6     2
	1     3     5     7     9
	2     4     6     8    10


Trying to concatenate two matrices. Matrix A:

	2     3     4     5     6
	3     4     5     6     2
	1     3     5     7     9
	2     4     6     8    10


Matrix B:

	0     1
	1     0
	1     1
	0     0


After concatenating B to the right of A. A becomes:

	2     3     4     5     6     0     1
	3     4     5     6     2     1     0

	2     4     6     8    10     0     0


Testing the copy constructor.
The following shows a Matrix C, created from copying the Matrix B above:

	0     1
	1     0
	1     1
	0     0


Now, we make some changes to matrix C. It becomes:

	0     5
	1     0
	4     1
	0     0


We print matrix B in the following. Note if the implementation is correct,
changing matrix C should not affect matrix B!

	0     1
	1     0
	1     1
	0     0


Testing the assignment operator.
The following shows a Matrix D, which is assigned with the Matrix B above:

	0     1
	1     0
	1     1
	0     0


Now, we make some changes to matrix D. It becomes:

	0     1
	1    10
	1     1
	28     0


We print matrix B in the following. Note if the implementation is correct,
changing matrix D should not affect matrix B!

	0     1
	1     0
	1     1
	0     0


Adding matrix D to matrix B using the += operator.
After this, the matrix B becomes:
	0     2
	2    10
	2     2
	28     0


Testing compatibility issue using += operator
Matrix A dimension: 4 x 7 and Matrix B dimension: 4 x 2
Perform A += B and failed!
Error: incompatible matrices for += operation!
Matrix A remains the same after the failed operation
	2     3     4     5     6     0     1
	3     4     5     6     2     1     0
	1     3     5     7     9     1     1
	2     4     6     8    10     0     0
